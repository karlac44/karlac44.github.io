<h1>Storytelling</h1>
-describes how the storytellers connect the films to their personal lives
-stories take a lot of time and effort to develope
-it take time to develop stories which is why it takes a group of people to come together and as a collective add and take away some aspects of the stories to try and perfect the story to the best of their ability.
-it is important to make sure that you don't loose yourself to try and develop a story because if you canâ€™t connect with the story than the viewers are also going to have a hard time connecting to the story.
